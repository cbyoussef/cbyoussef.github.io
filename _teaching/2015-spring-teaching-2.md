Instructor of record
======
**LING 102**. *Programming for Linguists*.

> Hands-on introduction to programming in Python, with emphasis on methods for retrieving, structuring, and interacting with textual data. Focus on developing practical programming skills and transferable methodology, such as debugging, task decomposition and abstraction, and best practices for documenting and structuring code. Targeted toward students with no programming background.


**LING 110**. *Foundations of Computational Linguistics*.

> An introduction to foundational ideas in computational linguistics, such as: n-gram language models; noisy channel models; supervised and unsupervised learning; and distributional semantics. Focus on developing an understanding of the intuitions behind the ideas, including relevant algorithms and math, and implementing this understanding in hands-on programming applications.

**LING 180**. *Language, Race, and Ethnicity*.

> Linguistic practices of major ethnoracial groups in the United States, including African Americans, Asian Americans, European Americans, Latinxs, and Native Americans; examination of the linguistic effects of immigration and colonialism; bilingualism, translanguaging, language shift, and heritage language learning; linguistic interaction and contact between ethnoracial groups; language as a resource for ethnoracial identity; linguistic racism; linguistic activism. 


**FR 4**. *Intermediate French*.

> First in a three-quarter intermediate French series. Builds on foundation established in first-year and includes thorough review of French grammar. Speaking and writing skills developed through exposure to French and Francophone culture, literature, and film.

Teaching Assistant
======
**LING 111**. *Advanced Computational Linguistics*.

> Provides advanced topics in computational linguistics, with an emphasis on statistical natural language processing techniques, co-occurrence methods, and machine learning applied to language.


**LING 102**. *Programming for Linguists*.

> Hands-on introduction to programming in Python, with emphasis on methods for retrieving, structuring, and interacting with textual data. Focus on developing practical programming skills and transferable methodology, such as debugging, task decomposition and abstraction, and best practices for documenting and structuring code. Targeted toward students with no programming background.

**LING 104**. *Statistical Methods in Linguistics*.

> Fundamentals of scientific inquiry and methodology; basics of experimental design, statistical methods (descriptive, analytic, and exploratory) relevant to linguistics.

**LING 105**. *Predictive Modeling in Linguistics*.

> Advanced methods in quantitative linguistics. Topics may include data exploration and visualization, classification trees, random forests, regression modeling, bootstrap methods, and Bayesian data analysis. Emphasis on building predictive models of linguistic data, with a focus on simulation, model comparison, and performance evaluation. Students complete statistical programming assignments and projects using real-world data.

**LING 120**. *Corpus Linguistics*.

> An introduction to computerized research methods which are applied to large databases of language used in natural communicative settings to supplement more traditional ways of linguistic analysis in all linguistic subdisciplines.

**LING 180**. *Language, Race, and Ethnicity*.

> Linguistic practices of major ethnoracial groups in the United States, including African Americans, Asian Americans, European Americans, Latinxs, and Native Americans; examination of the linguistic effects of immigration and colonialism; bilingualism, translanguaging, language shift, and heritage language learning; linguistic interaction and contact between ethnoracial groups; language as a resource for ethnoracial identity; linguistic racism; linguistic activism.

**LING 15**. *Language in Life*.

> Overview of language and its role in communities at home and around the world. The diversity and history of languages; their norms, conventions, and written traditions; the role of language in culture and identity; language rights and multilingualism, and the implications of technology for language use.
