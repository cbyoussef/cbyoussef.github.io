I'm a PhD student in <a href="https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">the Department of Linguistics</a> at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I grew up in 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beja,+Tunisia/@36.589459,9.3973874,333067m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x12fb588073d15b35:0x67e6f1f9d0f178b2!8m2!3d36.7333193!4d9.1843676" target="_blank">باجة Beja, Tunisia</a>, then left rather early to Paris, France, where I --among other things-- started my journey in linguistics research. 

I'm a linguist that uses computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, and psycholinguistics methodologies to investigate a diverse range of cognitive, structural, and sociocultural questions; with a focus on techniques that allow for the quantitative analysis of low resource languages and imbalanced/sample biased data sets. Currently, I'm contributing to multiple collaborative projects:

* Code-switching (CS) from Tunisian to French in naturally occurring conversations.<sup>*</sup>
* Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) of the US radical-right media.<sup>*</sup>
* Implicit vocabulary learning by adults exposed to a given language in their ambient environment.
* Bisexuality in Experimental Sociophonetics.
* Inclusive teaching of computational linguistics to generalist (linguistics) students.

I obtained my BA in English linguistics, literature, culture and civilization, and my MA in Linguistics from the <a href="https://www.univ-paris8.fr/" target="_blank">Université Paris 8, Vincennes--Saint-Denis</a>. After occupying the position of lecturer in the department of French and Italian at UCSB, I joined the Linguistics department as a PhD student, where I work mainly with <a href="stgries.info/" target="_blank">Stefan Th. Gries</a> and <a href="https://sjtodd.github.io/" target="_blank">Simon Todd</a>.

I also play guitar, chess, and spend (not enough) time watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/enahoua/films/" target="_blank">films, TV series</a>, and listing to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/w799hdeiwu9qtl0ffcs8c0yxk?si=5e0b0eba5d794691" target="_blank">Metal, Grunge, Punk, Alternative rock, Trip-Hop, modern Arabic music... </a> I love cooking and have to often deal with my stealthy cat hunting for (easy) prays around the kitchen.
