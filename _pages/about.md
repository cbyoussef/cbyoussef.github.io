I'm Chadi [ˈʃɛdi; SHE-dee], a postdoctoral researcher  at <a href="https://www.unine.ch/anglais" target="_blank">the English Institute</a> at the Université de Neuchâtel, Switzerland. I grew up in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9ja" target="_blank">باجة Beja, Tunisia</a>, then left rather early to Paris, France, where I --among other things-- started my journey in linguistics research. 

I'm a linguist that uses computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, and psycholinguistics methodologies to investigate a diverse range of cognitive, structural, and sociocultural questions; with a focus on techniques that allow for the quantitative analysis of low resource languages and imbalanced/sample biased data sets. My dissertation work focuses on Multi-Word Expressions (MWE), using corpus linguistics informed measures and <a href="https://julialang.org/" target="_blank">the Julia programming language</a>. Currently, my postdoc project—*Detecting connectivity changes inductively in a network of constructions*—aims at contributing to the development of Diachronic Construction Grammar (Noël 2007, Traugott and Trousdale 2013, Hilpert 2021) as a general theory of language change.

I obtained my BA in English Philology (linguistics, literature, culture and civilization), and my MA in Linguistics from the <a href="https://www.univ-paris8.fr/" target="_blank">Université Paris 8, Vincennes--Saint-Denis</a>. After occupying the position of lecturer in the department of French and Italian at UCSB, I joined the Linguistics department as a PhD student, where I obtained my PhD in Lingusitics under the supervision of <a href="https://www.stgries.info" target="_blank">Stefan Th. Gries</a>.

I also play guitar, chess, and spend (not enough) time watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/enahoua/films/" target="_blank">films, TV series</a>, and listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/w799hdeiwu9qtl0ffcs8c0yxk?si=5e0b0eba5d794691" target="_blank">Metal, Grunge, Punk, Alternative rock, Trip-Hop, modern Arabic music... </a> I love cooking and have to often deal with my stealthy cat hunting for (easy) prays around the kitchen.
